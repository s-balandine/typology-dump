The treatments artemether-lumefantrine  artesunate-amodiaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were evaluated in this study.  Objectives  Principal Objective:  To measure the clinical and parasitological efficacy of the three artemisinin combination therapies over a period of 42 days from the start of treatment and with PCR adjustment.  Secondary objectives  To determine the blood concentration of the non-artemisinin component of the treatment (lumefantrine  desethylamodiaquine or piperaquine) at day 7To assess the incidence of adverse events during the follow-up period;To measure speed of parasite clearance  Methods  In vivo non comparative study as for WHO standardised protocol with a module to estimate concentration of the non-artemisinin component. The target population is children under 5 years of age consulting the integrated health centres of Andoumé and Dix-sept portes in Maradi. Sample size: 221 patients per study treatment; 663 patients in total. Treatments were allocated randomly.  Outcomes: Early treatment failure  Late clinical failure  Late parasitological failure  Adequate clinical and parasitological response.  Analysis: Cumulative success or failure rate (Kaplan-Meier analysis) and proportions of early treatment failures  late clinical failures  late parasitological failures  and adequate clinical and parasitological response (Per-protocol analysis).  Reporting  Study recruitment started in June 2013 and ended in October 2014. Results were presented at the Epicentre Scientific Day in 2015. Epicentre report not delivered yet. We are waiting for further PCR analyses at MRTC to confirm CERMES lab results.     &nbsp;,"<p>total financé par le BI : 550 081  (le reste pour OCP si dépassement)</p><p>dépenses 2015 à financer par OCP</p><p style=""font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Calibri  sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 13.3333px;""><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>  <p style=""font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Calibri  sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 13.3333px;""><strong>Background</strong></p>  <p style=""font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Calibri  sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 13.3333px;"">Although Niger adopted ACTs as first line treatment for malaria  little is known on ACTs efficacy in the country.

Methods  We compared performance and time to become negative three RDTs (two HRP2 antigen-based and one pLDH) to blood smear microscopy in children under 5 years living in a high and a low malaria intensity setting in southwestern Uganda. In each setting  212 children who tested positive for RDTs and microscopy were treated with artemether-lumefantrine. RDTs and microscopy were then repeated at fixed intervals to estimate their time to negativity after patient recovery and parasite clearance.  Reporting  Study recruitment started in November 2011 and ended in August 2012. Results were presented at the Epicentre Scientific Day in 2013. Epicentre report was delivered in March 2014. Article was submitted to JID in December 2015.  Main Results: In the two settings  sensitivities ranged from 98.4% to 99.2% for the HRP2-tests and 94.7% to 96.1% for the pLDH-test. Specificities were 98.9% and 98.8% for the HRP2-tests and 99.7% for the pLDH-test in the low-transmission setting and 79.7%  80.7% and 93.9%  respectively  in the high-transmission setting.

The goal of the present study is to collect additional data on the efficacy profile of a candidate rotavirus vaccine in a randomized controlled setting  while gaining further experience with vaccine-related adverse events  and immunogenicity.&nbsp;  Methods The primary endpoint is vaccine efficacy of a candidate vaccine vs. placebo against a first episode of laboratory confirmed severe rotavirus gastroenteritis from 28 days post-Dose 3 until 117 cases are accrued or when all participating infants reach 2 years of age if 117 cases are not attained. The study is designed as a double-blinded  randomized  placebo-controlled  end-point driven trial with two groups of infants receiving vaccine or placebo (1:1 allocation) to assess the efficacy and safety of three doses of BRV-PV (Serum Institute or India  LLTD).

Background This study aim to validate a simple and rapid tool (the PSYCa 6-36) that non-specialists can use to screen for psychological difficulties in young children in different cultural contexts. In 2015  a first validation was completed in Kenya (n=500) and a secondary validation in Cambodia (n=181). To ensure that the scale is cross-culturally validated  we aim to conduct another secondary validation in Uganda (Mbarara). &nbsp; Methods  The first stage will consist of adapting the PSYCa 6-36 questionnaire to the context and translating it into local language. The second stage will examine the psychometric properties and external validity of the PSYCa 6-36 as used by trained lay interviewers  on a sample of 181 children drawn from the general population. Scores obtained to the PSYCa 6-36 will be compared against individual clinical interviews (Gold standard) performed by a psychologist with the caregiver of each participating child.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Reporting A report combining the results from Kenya and Cambodia will be circulated to technical referent of the medical department by the end of 2015 as well as to the field teams.

En 2014 nous avons réalisé une évaluation de la mutation des marqueurs de la résistance à la SP et à l AQ dans des zones après un ou deux cycles de CPS.  Objectives  Estimer la proportion d infections à P. falciparum avec des mutations dans les marqueurs pfdhfr et pfdhps pour le SP et pfcrt et pfmdr pour l AQ&nbsp;;Comparer les proportions de mutations moléculaires entre les aires de santé qui ont eu deux rounds de CPS  les aires de santé qui ont un round de CPS et les aires de santé qui n ont pas encore eu aucun CPS  mais qui l aurons en 2014.  Methods  Etude transversale chez les enfants de moins de 15 ans atteint de paludisme (TDR positif). La participation consiste à un seul prélèvement de sang capillaire. L échantillon de sang est récolté sur un papier filtre et envoyé dans le laboratoire du MRTC (Bamako) pour l analyse.

On-going clinical studies assessing immunogenicity of different vaccines delivered with PharmaJet will not  however  provide the required immunogenicity information for measles vaccine.

A second phase will evaluate the contribution of this device to mass vaccination campaigns. Methods The first part of the study is a randomized non-inferiority trial. Around 500 children will be randomized to receive the first measles dose in routine vaccination activities with PharmaJet or needle and syringe. Measles antibody titres will be measured at inclusion and 4 weeks post-vaccination. Caretakers will be administered a questionnaire to assess acceptability.

A key use of vaccine  if shown to be efficacious  will be through the vaccination of FLW working in endemic or epidemic contexts. Methods  Open-label  non-randomized  immunogenicity evaluation of one intramuscular (deltoid) injection of rVSV?G-EBOV-GP (2x107 PFU). The primary objective is to explore whether the pre-existing level of ZEBOV-GP specific antibodies among FLW is related to the previous professional exposure to EVD  and whether this affects the immunogenicity of one intramuscular dose of 2x107 PFU of rVSV?G-EBOV-GP vaccine. The primary outcome is total IgG against ZEBOV-GP at day 0 (prior to vaccination) and 28-days post-vaccination. &nbsp;A total of 1200 front-line workers are enrolled and followed for 180 days for safety and immunogencity outcomes. An accompanying sub-study examines the reasons for participation and non-participation in the study.  Reporting Results are reported to MSF-OCB (Medical Director) on a weekly basis.
