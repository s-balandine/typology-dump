3351,3352,Pour le projet 831 082   Neonatal sepsis Aweil et Jahun - Ce projet n est pas commencé et ne commencera pas avant la fin de l année. - Mais je n ai rien retiré du budget tel que Estelle l avait mis parce que je ne veux pas perdre tout ce qui est mis en 2019 si je dois le mettre en 2020. - A priori pour 2019  il faudra garder les jours d expertise - Par ailleurs  avec notre façon actuelle de fonctionner (coûts terrain restent sur le terrain)  il y a des lignes qui vont sauter. Pour les projets 832 128 (OCG HCV support) et 832 129 (OCB HCV support) - Comme convenu  je n ai rien changé dans les jours budgétés. ,"",2019-10-26 ,21,1317,0

3391,3392,Pour le projet 831 082   Neonatal sepsis Aweil et Jahun - Ce projet n est pas commencé et ne commencera pas avant la fin de l année. - Mais je n ai rien retiré du budget tel que Estelle l avait mis parce que je ne veux pas perdre tout ce qui est mis en 2019 si je dois le mettre en 2020. - A priori pour 2019  il faudra garder les jours d expertise - Par ailleurs  avec notre façon actuelle de fonctionner (coûts terrain restent sur le terrain)  il y a des lignes qui vont sauter. Pour les projets 832 128 (OCG HCV support) et 832 129 (OCB HCV support) - Comme convenu  je n ai rien changé dans les jours budgétés. ,,2019-10-29 ,165,1317,2
