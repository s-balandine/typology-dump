The treatments artemether-lumefantrine  artesunate-amodiaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were evaluated in this study.  Objectives  Principal Objective:  To measure the clinical and parasitological efficacy of the three artemisinin combination therapies over a period of 42 days from the start of treatment and with PCR adjustment.  Secondary objectives  To determine the blood concentration of the non-artemisinin component of the treatment (lumefantrine  desethylamodiaquine or piperaquine) at day 7To assess the incidence of adverse events during the follow-up period;To measure speed of parasite clearance  Methods  In vivo non comparative study as for WHO standardised protocol with a module to estimate concentration of the non-artemisinin component. The target population is children under 5 years of age consulting the integrated health centres of Andoumé and Dix-sept portes in Maradi. Sample size: 221 patients per study treatment; 663 patients in total. Treatments were allocated randomly.  Outcomes: Early treatment failure  Late clinical failure  Late parasitological failure  Adequate clinical and parasitological response.  Analysis: Cumulative success or failure rate (Kaplan-Meier analysis) and proportions of early treatment failures  late clinical failures  late parasitological failures  and adequate clinical and parasitological response (Per-protocol analysis).  Reporting  Study recruitment started in June 2013 and ended in October 2014. Results were presented at the Epicentre Scientific Day in 2015. Epicentre report not delivered yet.

Methods  We compared performance and time to become negative three RDTs (two HRP2 antigen-based and one pLDH) to blood smear microscopy in children under 5 years living in a high and a low malaria intensity setting in southwestern Uganda. In each setting  212 children who tested positive for RDTs and microscopy were treated with artemether-lumefantrine. RDTs and microscopy were then repeated at fixed intervals to estimate their time to negativity after patient recovery and parasite clearance.  Reporting  Study recruitment started in November 2011 and ended in August 2012. Results were presented at the Epicentre Scientific Day in 2013. Epicentre report was delivered in March 2014. Article was submitted to JID in December 2015.  Main Results: In the two settings  sensitivities ranged from 98.4% to 99.2% for the HRP2-tests and 94.7% to 96.1% for the pLDH-test. Specificities were 98.9% and 98.8% for the HRP2-tests and 99.7% for the pLDH-test in the low-transmission setting and 79.7%  80.7% and 93.9%  respectively  in the high-transmission setting.

The goal of the present study is to collect additional data on the efficacy profile of a candidate rotavirus vaccine in a randomized controlled setting  while gaining further experience with vaccine-related adverse events  and immunogenicity.&nbsp;  Methods The primary endpoint is vaccine efficacy of a candidate vaccine vs. placebo against a first episode of laboratory confirmed severe rotavirus gastroenteritis from 28 days post-Dose 3 until 117 cases are accrued or when all participating infants reach 2 years of age if 117 cases are not attained. The study is designed as a double-blinded  randomized  placebo-controlled  end-point driven trial with two groups of infants receiving vaccine or placebo (1:1 allocation) to assess the efficacy and safety of three doses of BRV-PV (Serum Institute or India  LLTD).  Reporting Monthly update reports are provided to MSF-OCG (Medical Director and 2IM). Annual reports are provided to all ERBS and OCG.

Background This study aim to validate a simple and rapid tool (the PSYCa 6-36) that non-specialists can use to screen for psychological difficulties in young children in different cultural contexts. In 2015  a first validation was completed in Kenya (n=500) and a secondary validation in Cambodia (n=181). To ensure that the scale is cross-culturally validated  we aim to conduct another secondary validation in Uganda (Mbarara). &nbsp; Methods  The first stage will consist of adapting the PSYCa 6-36 questionnaire to the context and translating it into local language. The second stage will examine the psychometric properties and external validity of the PSYCa 6-36 as used by trained lay interviewers  on a sample of 181 children drawn from the general population. Scores obtained to the PSYCa 6-36 will be compared against individual clinical interviews (Gold standard) performed by a psychologist with the caregiver of each participating child.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Reporting A report combining the results from Kenya and Cambodia will be circulated to technical referent of the medical department by the end of 2015 as well as to the field teams. Another report for the results in Uganda will be circulated at the end of the project in 2016.,"<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot; &quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">Project title</span></strong></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot; &quot;sans-serif&quot;;&#xA;mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">Development and cross cultural validation of a screening tool for psychological difficulties in children aged 6 to 36 months (PSYCa 6-36)</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot; &quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">&nbsp;</span></strong></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""font-family: Helv  sans-serif;"" lang=""EN-US"">Background</span></strong></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot; &quot;sans-serif&quot;;&#xA;mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">This study aim to validate a simple and rapid tool (the PSYCa 6-36) that non-specialists can use to screen for psychological difficulties in young children in different cultural contexts.

En 2014 nous avons réalisé une évaluation de la mutation des marqueurs de la résistance à la SP et à l AQ dans des zones après un ou deux cycles de CPS.  Objectives  Estimer la proportion d infections à P. falciparum avec des mutations dans les marqueurs pfdhfr et pfdhps pour le SP et pfcrt et pfmdr pour l AQ&nbsp;;Comparer les proportions de mutations moléculaires entre les aires de santé qui ont eu deux rounds de CPS  les aires de santé qui ont un round de CPS et les aires de santé qui n ont pas encore eu aucun CPS  mais qui l aurons en 2014.  Methods  Etude transversale chez les enfants de moins de 15 ans atteint de paludisme (TDR positif). La participation consiste à un seul prélèvement de sang capillaire.

On-going clinical studies assessing immunogenicity of different vaccines delivered with PharmaJet will not  however  provide the required immunogenicity information for measles vaccine.

A second phase will evaluate the contribution of this device to mass vaccination campaigns. Methods The first part of the study is a randomized non-inferiority trial. Around 500 children will be randomized to receive the first measles dose in routine vaccination activities with PharmaJet or needle and syringe. Measles antibody titres will be measured at inclusion and 4 weeks post-vaccination. Caretakers will be administered a questionnaire to assess acceptability.

A key use of vaccine  if shown to be efficacious  will be through the vaccination of FLW working in endemic or epidemic contexts. Methods  Open-label  non-randomized  immunogenicity evaluation of one intramuscular (deltoid) injection of rVSV?G-EBOV-GP (2x107 PFU). The primary objective is to explore whether the pre-existing level of ZEBOV-GP specific antibodies among FLW is related to the previous professional exposure to EVD  and whether this affects the immunogenicity of one intramuscular dose of 2x107 PFU of rVSV?G-EBOV-GP vaccine. The primary outcome is total IgG against ZEBOV-GP at day 0 (prior to vaccination) and 28-days post-vaccination. &nbsp;A total of 1200 front-line workers are enrolled and followed for 180 days for safety and immunogencity outcomes. An accompanying sub-study examines the reasons for participation and non-participation in the study.  Reporting Results are reported to MSF-OCB (Medical Director) on a weekly basis.

Thus a system that allows specimens to be preserved at room temperature in order to allow delay prior to testing with Xpert and liquid culture would be very useful. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of OMNIgene® SPUTUM&nbsp; reagent to prolong the pre-test time when added to samples that require shipment prior testing with culture and Xpert. Methods  Prospective study. The ability of OMNIgene® SPUTUM to preserve and decontaminate samples prior testing with both Xpert and culture will be assessed by calculating positivity rate and indeterminate results for Xpert in comparison to untreated samples  then positivity rate and contamination rate for culture in comparison to samples decontaminated with Nalc-NaOH standard method.

On-going clinical studies assessing immunogenicity of different vaccines delivered with PharmaJet will not  however  provide the required immunogenicity information for measles vaccine. Consequently  a first phase of this study aims to prove the non-inferiority of measles vaccine delivered with PharmaJet device and also get initial data on acceptability. A second phase will evaluate the contribution of this device to mass vaccination campaigns. Methods The first part of the study is a randomized non-inferiority trial. Around 500 children will be randomized to receive the first measles dose in routine vaccination activities with PharmaJet or needle and syringe. Measles antibody titres will be measured at inclusion and 4 weeks post-vaccination. Caretakers will be administered a questionnaire to assess acceptability. In a second step  a demonstration project will be implemented to assess advantages and disadvantages of PharmaJet in a measles mass vaccination campaign.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) would be extremely useful for the early detection of cholera cases. Several rapid tests are commercially available but few have been evaluated in field conditions. Most evaluations have focused on Crystal VC O1 & O139 (Arkray) and have shown high sensitivity but moderate specificity of this test  with problematic false-positive O139 results. The performance of the test was increased when adding a first step of enrichment in alkaline peptone water (APW) for 4-6 hours. More recently  a first evaluation of the SD Bioline Cholera Ag O1/O139 test (Standard Diagnostics) has shown promising results in Zambia  though on a limited number of samples. In addition  a new version of the Crystal VC test  detecting only O1 strains  will become available before the end of the year. We would like to assess the performance of these two promising tests in field conditions. We would also like to evaluate the performance of the tests after enrichment in APW  as a possible way to increase the performance of the test.    ,<p>Preparation of the study on cholera RDT evaluation (order  tools  etc.). </p><p>Note: implementation of the study might be done by another section (depending on cholera outbreaks and feasibility of the study)  in which case another code might be open<br /><br /></p>,1,,4,176,8,2,1,22,285,33,894,4,"",1,"",,"","","","",,1,,,,,,"",,0,"","",3,2,,2,1,1,,1,8,3,,6,E2DC53FD-869B-49CB-B66B-3FB2C3956C30

Although a PFHRP2-based test is the national standard rapid diagnostic test  studies in similar settings have suggested that the Carestart pLDH(pan) test would perform better and lead to more accurate diagnostics due to having equal sensitivity and improved specificity compared to the PFHRP2 test. In 2017  following several years of advocacy by MSF  the South Sudan MOH accepted that MSF switch in 2018 to using the Carestart pLDH(pan) test in MSF-supported IPD and OPD services provided in Aweil Hospital  in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State. A formal evaluation of pLDH performance is warranted to monitor its introduction in Aweil and as further documentation of its performance.  Primary Objective Estimate the performance (sensitivity  specificity  positive predictive value  and negative predictive value) of the CareStart malaria pLDH and the SD Bioline PFHRP2 RDT during low and high transmission season.  ,,1,,84,176,8,2,1,,5,84,948,2,2019 - EVAL TESTS MALARIA AWEIL,4,"",,"","","","",,1,,1,,,,"",1,0,"","",3,6,3,2,1,1,,1,8,3,,22,2C19F795-27BF-478E-A449-B50470DB2F49

The trial is a double-blind  randomised  placebo-controlled trial. The target population is healthcare workers (or frontline workers) who can be reliably followed up for 5 months. For this proposal  we are asking for funding to participate in this multi-centric trial with the primary aim of establishing the prophylactic utility of hydroxychloroquine. A total of 400 participants will be recruited in Niger. Data will be pooled across all enrolling sites  where the entire trial has an estimated sample size of 40 000. ,,1,,43,161,1,2,1,,,43,1150,4,COPCOV,2,"",,"",COVID 19,Adults,Frontline and Healthcare Workers,,3,,,,,,"",1,0,Oxford University,"",4,2,3,2,4,1,,1,4,3,,1,4A60591C-A8F6-4BC9-A656-B71F256A5686

It is estimated that 96% of children who die with TB are never put on treatment  80% of them are less than 5 years old . In 2021 WHO estimated that there were 1.1 million children with TB and that 60% of them were not diagnosed . Under diagnosis and subsequent under treatment of TB in children is multifactorial. Non-specific symptoms in children and difficulty to collect diagnostic specimens contribute  as does the lack of access to radiography and sensitive molecular tests such as Xpert. However  even in settings with access to bacteriological testing  less than 30% of children will have bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis due to the paucibacillary nature of TB in children  especially younger children. Children are also often neglected in under resourced settings due to the non-infectious nature of tuberculosis in this group.  In March 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Tuberculosis Programme published new recommendations on the use of integrated treatment decision algorithms in children with presumptive pulmonary TB attending health care facilities to diagnose pulmonary TB. Integrated treatment decision algorithms are flowcharts which allocate evidence-based scores to microbiological  clinical and radiological features that allow clinicians to make decisions regarding the initiation of TB treatment in children. This recommendation was formulated by WHO as an interim  conditional recommendation  considering the need for additional evidence. WHO has called for the generation of evidence through external validation and associated studies to inform a future review of the 2022 generic recommendation on the management of TB in children and adolescents. The aim of this study is to assess the performance and feasibility of implementing the 2022 WHO treatment decision algorithms. ,,1,,26,176,8,2,1,,,26,1309,2,TB diagnosis in children - OCB,,"",,"","",moins de 10 ans,"",,0,,,,,,"",1,0,"","",,,,2,,,,,,,,40,432766D1-52F9-4D22-8C03-E4643083D717
